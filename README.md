# README
## For co-workers
- I am a team player, I don't like working as individual. I don't learn anything from working alone.
- I see code reviewing as important tool for learning, I learn from reading other people code and I learn how to teach from that too.
- I don't mind if you criticize me, I actually love it. If I do something wrong, please tell.
- I prefer the idea of shipping small things frequently other than release a big chunk of feature at once. [Simple, correct, fast: in that order](https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html)

## For employers
### Please consider me if ...
- **You want teamwork**, as I wrote above, I am a team player.
- **You want to establish teamwork**, I used to be in very good teamwork before and I know how to do it again.
- **You want a senior developer who can mentor**, I personally interested in developing this skill. I also learned a lot from teaching people too.
- **You want a person who care about code quality**, I am not the most beautiful code writer in the world but I want to.

### Don't consider me if ...
- **You want me to work 24/7**, because I only work 8 hours a day.
- **You don't have QA and you don't think QA is necessary for development process**, because my code always have bugs and I'm not gonna find 100% of them.
