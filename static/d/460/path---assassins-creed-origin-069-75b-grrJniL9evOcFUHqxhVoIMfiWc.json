Everything was crafted to make you feels so satisfy and crave for more, just a little more before I’m going to bed (and you know the result).</p>\n<p>Plus, the combat system has improved a lot since my last play of the series many years ago (Brotherhood maybe?), it is not counter button mashing anymore. You can now change your gears, shield, various type of melee weapons and bows which they a have slightly different style of gameplay for you to use and collect.</p>\n<p>The Trophies also not hard to be completed, no skill required just need more time after finished all the main quests. I got the Platinum in like, 60-70 hours.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Assassin's Creed: Origin","date":"March 07, 2021","lang":null,"langs":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/assassins-creed-origin/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/note-the-dalai-lama-s-cat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Dalai Lama's Cat","lang":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-bullet-journal-method/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Bullet Journal Method","lang":null}}}}
