Aside from his skill (He’s one of <code class=\"language-text\">react</code> team members and creator of <code class=\"language-text\">redux</code>), he wrote articles and documents with friendly tone and described technical topic in simple way that make them so enjoyable to read. This website also <del>copied from</del> influenced by <a href=\"https://overreacted.io\">his blog</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Game</strong>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UAO2urG23S4\">Hollow Knight</a>. Solid game design (2D souls-like) great music and visual.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Item</strong>, nothing. I barely bought anything new in 2018 (clothes excluded). This bullet point is just to brag about buying less.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Movie</strong>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_%28film%29\">Hereditary</a>. A horror movie that has very little jump scare combine with weird, shock and unpredictable moment made watching the movie was my best movie experience of 2018 so far. <strong>WARNING don’t watch trailer or read synopsis so you can fully experience feelings I described above.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Music band</strong>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1BHYRsFqV0ON7RUFM9qF2Q?si=2uEhCALaRN2IoRYk41Bplw\">Telex Telexs</a>. Best synth-pop band in Thailand (I don’t know much though).

This time was better because I went there with my girl and it was super fun. I don’t want to travel without her anymore.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Word</strong>, Focus. Simple but difficult to execute because we have so many distractions these days. I use this word to remind myself that don’t give a shit about things that don’t matter, set <a href=\"https://warizz.github.io/goals-2019/\">goals</a>, prioritize and one step at a time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Best of 2018","date":"January 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/best-of-2018/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/mistakes-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mistakes in 2019"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-cleaner-way-to-compose-components/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cleaner way to compose components"}}}}
