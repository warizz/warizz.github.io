Not in a noisy or intrusive way — just active enough to entertain us during those periods when we choose to remain awake .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I like the phrase “when we keep to remain awake”. It is so cat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She treated me to a helping of leftover beef casserole so generous that I had to meow to be put down from the kitchen counter after eating , being too stuffed to jump down on my own .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cute</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ Isn’t that interesting ? Only this morning at the temple , we saw novice monks competing for admission to the monastery . There are too many novices and not enough places . But turning to the jail , nobody wants to go there , even though the conditions are easier than in a monastery . This proves that it is not so much the circumstances of our lives that make us happy or unhappy but the way we see them . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>True</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ To stop thinking about their time inside as a waste of their life and instead to see it as an amazing opportunity for personal growth .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(inside means in the jail) I can use this to turn any boring situation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ The purpose of Buddhism is not to convert people . It is to give them tools so they can create greater happiness . So they can be happier Catholics , happier atheists , happier Buddhists . There are many practices , and I know you are already very familiar with one of them . ” Mrs . Trinci raised her eyebrows . “ It is the wonderful paradox , ” he continued , “ that the best way to achieve happiness for oneself is to give happiness to others . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Buddhism Is just a tool.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By letting go of the unhappiness - creating belief that I needed another cat , I would convert my jail into a monastery .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Three</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If they wanted to drink a cup of coffee without actually experiencing it , why didn’t they do it for free back at the hotel ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mindful eating.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment deliberately and non - judgmentally .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>when their coffee was placed in front of them , they stopped their conversation and actually tasted it . Not only the first mouthful but also the second , third , and subsequent mouthfuls . Like the monks at Jokhang , they were paying attention to the present moment deliberately . Relishing their coffee . Enjoying their surroundings . Experiencing pure presence .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cool</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Turns out that it’s not so much what you’re doing that makes you happy . It’s whether or not you’re being mindful of what you’re doing .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Four</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dissatisfaction with the material world is — what do you say ? — vital to spiritual development . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ A cause that can be relied upon . One that always works . Heat applied to water is a true cause of steam . No matter who applies the heat or how often the heat has been applied before or where in the world heat is applied , the result is always steam . In the case of money or status or relationships ” — His Holiness chuckled — “ we can easily see these are not true causes of happiness . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Good metaphor</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The danger is that self - development can lead us to more self - cherishing , self - absorption , self - infatuation . And these are not true causes of happiness but the opposite . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Self self self</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ We each need to find out our own personal methods of cultivating happiness , but there are general principles . Two main true causes of happiness : first , the wish to give happiness to others , which Buddhists define as love , and second , the wish to help free others from dissatisfaction or suffering , which we define as compassion .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the prefrontal cortex of the brain , the part linked to positive emotion , lights up when people meditate on the happiness of others . Therefore , the more ‘ other - centric ’ we are , the happier we can be . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ A man arrives home to find a huge pile of sheep manure has been dumped on his front yard . He didn’t order the manure . He does not want it . But somehow , it is there , and his only choice now is to decide what to do with it . He can put it in his pockets and walk around all day complaining to everyone about what happened . But if he does this , people will start avoiding him after a while . More useful is if he spreads the manure on his garden . “ We all face this same choice when dealing with problems . We don’t ask for them . We don’t want them . But the way we deal with them is what’s most important . If we are wise , the greatest problems can lead to the greatest insights . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also discovered that I felt a lot happier not being jealous . Envy and resentment were demanding emotions that had disturbed my own peace of mind . For my sake , too , there was little point in being consumed by unhappy and irrational feelings</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Five</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘ The thought manifests as the word ; the word manifests as the deed ; the deed develops into habit ; and habit hardens into character . So watch the thought and its ways with care , and let it spring from love born out of concern for all beings … As the shadow follows the body , as we think , so we become . ’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thought is the lowest level / atom?</p>\n<h1>Chapter Six</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ The Dharma is an inner journey , ” Geshe Wangpo said , touching his heart . “ Not about saying you are Buddhist , or wearing clothes to show you are Buddhist , or even believing you are Buddhist . What is ‘ Buddhist ’ ? ” He gestured with open hands . “ Just a word . Just a label . What is the value of a label if the product inside isn’t authentic ? Like a fake Rolex . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ The first teachings Buddha gave after he became enlightened were the Four Noble Truths . They are a very good place to begin an understanding .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Never know the English words brfore</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dukkha means everything from trivial discomfort to the deepest physical and emotional suffering .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ But the underlying reason for our dissatisfaction , the root cause , is that we mistake the way that things exist . We see objects and people as separate and independent from us . We believe them to have characteristics , qualities , that we are attracted to or repelled by . We think everything is happening outside us and we are just reacting to it — as though it’s all coming at us from the outside . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ If all this dissatisfaction , all this dukkha , were coming from out there , it would be impossible to do much about it . But because it originates in the mind itself , well , we have some hope . So the Fourth Noble Truth is the treatment — what we can do about our mental problems . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How we think is important</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Buddhism we also interpret Dharma to mean ‘ cessation , ’ as in the end of dissatisfaction , the end of dukkha . This is the purpose of Buddha’s teachings . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ You know , Buddha was once asked a mysterious question about the universe . The way he answered the question is very interesting . ” Geshe Wangpo bent down to scoop up a handful of leaves . “ He asked his students , ‘ Are there more leaves in my hand , or on the floor of the forest all around us ? ’ The students said , ‘ On the floor of the forest . ’ So Buddha replied , ‘ The leaves in my hand represent the knowledge that leads to the end of suffering . ’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The efficiency</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ It teaches us to become more aware of our own mental behavior , to replace negative patterns of thought with more positive ones . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘ Be your own therapist . ’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we focus too much on ourselves , we make ourselves sick . We have this constant inner chatter going morning , noon , and night , this inner monologue . But paradoxically , the more we are able to think about making other beings happy , the happier we become ourselves . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You begin at home and at work , with the people and other beings in your life . If you have customers , think of every one of them as an opportunity to practice loving kindness . You can serve them a coffee , or you can serve them a coffee and a smile — something that makes them happier for the moment they are with you . If you have a staff — well , you are a very important person in their lives . You have great power to make them happy — or miserable . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you first start , Dharma practice is like a trickle of water high on a mountain . The trickle affects just a small , green area an inch or two wide , as the water flows along the ground . But as you practice Dharma more and more , the flow gets stronger and is joined by other streams . It may occasionally falter , like a waterfall , or disappear beneath the surface , but it keeps going , gathering strength . Eventually , it becomes like a very large river that’s broad and powerful and the center of everything in your life . “ Think about your Dharma practice like that — every day growing more and more . Giving more and more happiness to others — and gaining more and more happiness yourself . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am talking here about change . A favorite Dalai Lama theme . The only constant in life , as Buddha himself said .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ When one is angry , the first person to suffer is oneself . No one who is angry has a happy , peaceful mind . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ Next , we ask ourselves , where is this anger coming from ? If the true cause of anger is the fridge or the gas or the lack of raspberries , then why isn’t everyone else angry at these things ? You see , the anger isn’t coming from out there . It’s coming from our mind . And that is a good thing , because we can’t control everything around us in the world , but we can learn to control our own mind . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And each time you give in to it , you feed the habit and make it more likely you will feel it again . Wouldn’t it be better , instead , to decrease its power ? ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ When our understanding of something deepens to the point that it changes our behavior , in the Dharma we call this a realization . Perhaps today you have made a realization ? ” “ Sì , sì , Your Holiness . ” Emotion tugged at her lips . “ I certainly have . ” “ Remember the words of the Buddha : ‘ Though one man may conquer a thousand men a thousand times in battle , he who conquers himself is the greatest warrior . ’ ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we see for ourselves there is a problem , change becomes much easier . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ Yes . I decided , even if I can’t be vegetarian all the time , I will follow a vegetarian diet as much as possible but be moderate about it . Being vegetarian or non - vegetarian need not be black or white . We can find a middle ground . Sometimes eating meat for nutritional purposes , but all the time not necessary</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ Sentient beings are killed even for a vegetarian diet . When land is cleared to make space for crops , the natural habitat is destroyed , and many smaller beings are killed . Then crops are planted , and pesticides are sprayed , killing many thousands of insects . You see , it is very difficult to avoid harming other beings , especially in relation to food . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ You will find that some people tell you there is only one way , this way , which happens to be the way that they think , and that everyone else should change their views to be like them . But it is really a matter of personal choice . The important thing is to make sure our decisions are guided with compassion and wisdom . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ Before we eat any meal , vegetarian or meat , we should always remember the beings that have died so that we can eat . Their lives were just as important to them as your life is to you . Think of them with gratitude and pray that their sacrifice will be a cause for them to be reborn in a higher realm — and for you to be healthy , so that you can quickly , quickly reach full enlightenment in order to lead them to that same state . ”\nNote - Page 147 · Location 1876</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mindful Eating</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You know , Mahatma Gandhi once said : ‘ The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated . ’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ In the Dharma , there is no place for guilt . Guilt is useless . It is pointless to feel bad about something in the past that we can’t change . But regret ? Yes . This is more useful .\nNote - Page 150 · Location 1916</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Guilt vs regret</p>\n<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ One of the last things Buddha said to his followers was that anyone who believed a word he had taught them was a fool — unless they had tested it against their own experience . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ What if someone conducted tens of thousands of hours of rigorous investigation to discover truths about the nature of consciousness ? Suppose other people replicated the research over hundreds of years . How amazing would it be not just to have an intellectual understanding of the mind’s potential but also to establish the most rapid and direct way to realize it ? That is the science of Buddhism . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After this sudden outpouring , the stillness of Lobsang’s office was palpable . Lobsang gestured toward a pair of chairs in the corner . “ Would you like a cup of tea ? ”\nNote - Page 161 · Location 2047</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cool</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ I don’t have any special wisdom , ” said Lobsang , in the way that especially wise practitioners always do . “ I have no qualities or realizations . I don’t know why you think I can advise . ”\nNote - Page 162 · Location 2059</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Humble</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ Fear , ” said Lobsang . “ An instinct that prevents many people from taking actions that they know , deep down inside , would liberate them . Like a bird in a cage whose door has been opened , we are free to go out in search of fulfillment , but fear makes us look for all kinds of reasons not to . ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When crows encounter a dying snake , / They will act as though they were eagles . / Likewise , if my self - confidence is weak , / I shall be injured by the slightest downfall . ’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As the Dalai Lama frequently explains , inner development is something for which we must each take personal responsibility . Other beings cannot make us more mindful , so that we can experience the rich tapestry of everyday experience to the fullest . Similarly , other beings cannot force us to become more patient or kind , no matter how conducive to our contentment patience or kindness would be . As for improving concentration while meditating , this is , quite obviously , something we need to do for ourselves .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ It is most useful , ” Geshe Wangpo told Sam , “ to share one’s knowledge with others . Otherwise , what is the point in having it ? ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ In Buddhism ” — the lama tilted his head back challengingly — “ we would say that you are lazy . ” Sam’s reaction was the opposite of his usual . Color drained from his face . “ Despising yourself , thinking you are no good , saying ‘ I can’t do this . ’ This is the mind of weakness . You must work to overcome it . ” “ It’s not through choice , ” Sam protested faintly . “ Then you must choose to overcome . What happens if you keep giving in to a weak mind ? You feed weakness . The result is an even weaker mind in the future . Instead , you must cultivate confidence ! ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mind training is the foundation of all Buddhist activities , and we are encouraged to develop strong concentration not only when meditating but also by practicing mindfulness throughout each day . As one of the lamas explained , if we are not objectively aware of our thoughts moment by moment and instead engage with every one of them , how can we begin to change them ? “ You can’t manage what you don’t monitor , ” he said . Mindfulness , it seems , is a foundation practice .\nNote - Page 196 · Location 2484</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can practice any time</p>\n<h1>Epilogue</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ I am reading about the life of Albert Schweitzer , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952 . He was a very compassionate man , very sincere . I have just read something he said : ‘ Sometimes our light goes out , but is blown again into flame by an encounter with another human being . Each of us owes the deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this inner light . ’ I agree with that , don’t you , HHC ? ” Closing my eyes , I purred .\nNote - Page 204 · Location 2719</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wonderful ending</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My notes & hightlights from The Dalai Lama's Cat","date":"February 21, 2021","lang":null,"langs":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/me/note-the-dalai-lama-s-cat/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-nextjs-typescript-page-type/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React, NextJs and Typescript: What is correct type for a page","lang":null}},"next":null}}
